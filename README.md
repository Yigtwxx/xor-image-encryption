# xor-image-encryption
A simple image encryption and decryption tool using XOR with seed-based key generation. Supports RGB pixel-level encryption, histogram analysis, and multi-seed operations.

#  Dazzling XOR Image Encryption — Seed-Based, RGB-Level Crypto Engine

##  Introduction: The Art of Fast and Reversible Image Masking

**XOR Image Encryption** is a **lightweight**, **reversible**, and **seed-based** XOR encryption system designed for RGB images. It supports both single-seed and multi-seed encryption pipelines, offering completely **deterministic** and **perfectly reproducible** results suitable for **research**, **dataset anonymization**, **educational cryptography**, and **embedded systems**.

##   Key Capabilities: What Makes This Project Stand Out?

This library is not just an encryption tool; it's an engineering feat optimized for **speed** and **reproducibility**.

* **Seed-Based Key Generation**
    * **Deterministic** masks derived from integer seeds.
    * Guarantees perfect **reproducibility** and reversible encryption.
    * Essential for **dataset anonymization**.

* **RGB Channel XOR Engine**
    * **8-bit XOR** operation per R, G, and B channel.
    * **Extremely fast CPU performance** (via NumPy vectorization).
    * **Fully reversible** when applied with the identical seed.

* **Multi-Layer Encryption (`xor_multi.py`)**
    * **Cascaded encryption** using multiple seeds.
    * Provides higher diffusion and entropy.
    * Still perfectly reversible when using the full sequence of seeds.

* **Single-Layer Encryption (`xor_single.py`)**
    * **Lightweight** one-pass XOR encryption.
    * Perfect for demos and simple visual obfuscation.

##   Usage: Just a Few Lines of Code!

Using this library is incredibly simple.

###  Encrypt (Single Seed)

```python
from xor_single import encrypt_image

# All the magic is in this integer 'seed'!
encrypt_image(
    input_path="bugsbunny.jpg",
    output_path="outputs/encrypted.png",
    seed=12345
)
```
###  Decrypt (Single Seed)
```Python

from xor_single import decrypt_image

# Use the exact same 'seed' to restore the image.
decrypt_image(
    input_path="outputs/encrypted.png",
    output_path="outputs/restored.png",
    seed=12345

)
```
###  Multi-Seed Cascaded Encryption

For more robust masking!

```Python

from xor_multi import multi_encrypt, multi_decrypt

# Define a sequence of seeds
seeds = [111, 222, 333] # A different mask for each layer!

multi_encrypt(
    input_path="bugsbunny.jpg",
    output_path="outputs/multi_encrypted.png",
    seeds=seeds
)
```
###  Multi-Seed Decryption

Use the same list of seeds in the encryption order.

```Python

from xor_multi import multi_encrypt, multi_decrypt

seeds = [111, 222, 333] # THE ORDER MUST BE STRICTLY MAINTAINED!

multi_decrypt(
    input_path="outputs/multi_encrypted.png",
    output_path="outputs/multi_restored.png",
    seeds=seeds
)
```

## 🛡️ Security Notes and Use Cases
IMPORTANT: XOR encryption is not intended as a replacement for modern encryption standards (AES, ChaCha20, etc.). Our focus is on fast visual obfuscation and data masking rather than absolute confidentiality.

  -This project focuses on lightweight, reversible image masking suitable for:

  -Dataset Obfuscation: Anonymizing Machine Learning/AI (ML/AI) datasets.

  -Research & Education: Visualizing and teaching cryptography principles.

  -Embedded/IoT Usage: Fast offline operations with low computational requirements.

  -Fast Preprocessing: Near-zero latency in image processing pipelines.

## 📈 Performance: In the Blink of an Eye!

Incredible speeds are achieved thanks to the power of NumPy vectorization.

| Resolution | Encrypt Time | Decrypt Time | Hardware |
| :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :------: |
| **1080p** | ~1–3 ms      | ~1–3 ms      | CPU      |
| **4K** | ~5–10 ms     | ~5–10 ms     | CPU      |

* Powered by **NumPy Vectorization**.
* **Zero-copy** transformations.
* **Near-zero latency**.
